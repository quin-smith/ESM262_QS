### Linkage Mapper Tools for ArcGIS to find linkages between core gorilla habitat areas, then define which of these areas are a priority for protection due to threat from future climate and land-use change. 

#### Contract

- Goal - Determine areas that best support movement of gorillas from one "core area" to another based on land-use resistance.

**Module 1 - Build resistance map**

*Input* Raster map of land cover

*Parameters* Pixels of values classified to represent land cover types, classification schema, species-specific model parameters to estimate energetic costs of passing through each land cover type 

*Output* Raster map of resistance values (each cell value representing energetic cost of gorillas passing through)

**Module 2 - Build connectivity map**

*Input* Raster map of resistance values

*Parameters* Shapefile of core areas (National Parks/protected areas) to clip/confine core areas, shapefile of corridor areas to clip/confine corridor areas, model scripts (python) that use cost-weighted distance analysis to create a connected path of least-cost pixels between core areas (least-cost corridors)

*Output*  Raster map with connectivity/linkage quality values (each cell value representing energetic cost, classified as least to most cost, showing connections between core areas) 

**Module 3 - Build hazard/priority map**

*Input* Raster map of connectivity/linkage quality values

*Parameters* Pixel values representing degree of change in climate/land use variables over areas into the future

*Output* Raster map showing areas in the linkages that are the most threatened, indicating priority for protection
